## Problem 1
First, we will load in the `penguins` dataset.

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

This dataset contains 8 variables: penguin species, island, bill length in mm, flipper length in mm, body mass in gm, sex, and year. There are `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns. The mean flipper length is `r mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)` mm. 

Next, this is a scatterplot with `flipper_length_mm` (y) vs and `bill_length_mm` (x) with points colored using the `species` variable.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

Finally, we will export this scatterplot to the project directory as a PDF file.

```{r}
ggsave("scatterplot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```
